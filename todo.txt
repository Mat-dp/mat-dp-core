Implement load and dump methods for:
    Resources
    Processes
    data_utils.load_processes
    Constraints

Add CSV loader wrapper for the load and dump methods

Add native uncertainty to processes (decompose to lower and upper bound)

Redo constraint type helpers:
    Ratio to allow a ratio between arbitrarily many underlying processes
        Will require a bit of a refactor of the constraints interface
    Equal and less than for individual processes/resources
    Resource flow

Genericise use of List (to Sequence, MutableSequence, or other Container ABC as required)

Fix returned equation if problem too constrained

Test constrained solution solver

Report better errors for constrained solution solver

Fix bugs:
    unconstrained valueerror (ask Mark how to replicate)

Add mypy to pre-commit
